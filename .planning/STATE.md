## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Port-first, extract-second per page — content must exist before component APIs can be designed
- [Init]: Extract components when they (a) are reused, (b) name a concept, or (c) enforce a pattern — not for abstraction points

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: `TechnologiesPage.vue` and `ContactPage.vue` have nested `<main>` — invalid HTML breaking accessibility; must fix before adding pages
- [Phase 1]: `PhilosophyPage.vue` has four `<router-link>` tags to non-existent exhibit routes — no catch-all 404 route exists, failures are silent
- [Phase 4/v2]: Deployment hosting environment not confirmed — history-mode redirect config format differs by host (Netlify `_redirects` vs. others); confirm before go-live
